"""
Monocular Depth Estimation Loss Function Module.

This module defines a custom loss function class used in monocular depth estimation tasks with neural networks. This is achieved via the MonocularDepthLoss class.

The class is structured to be filled in with specific loss calculation logic by Alex Wang. Note it is required to use PyTorch tensors to ensure compatibility with PyTorch's automatic differentiatio features, crucial for effective backpropagation in neural network training.

    """
    This class defines a loss function used in monocular depth estimation.
    The loss function works as follows:
    1) Shift the pixels of the left image to generate the pseudo right image
    2) Shift the pixels of the right image to generate the pseudo left image
    3) Compare the pseudo right image and pseudo left image with real right image, and real
       left image, respectively. Use mean squared error for loss calculations
